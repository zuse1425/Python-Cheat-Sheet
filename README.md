# Python Notebook
This file is the ultimate cheat/learn sheet. The resources for leearning are mentioned in the notebook only(some in Hindi). Learn with this on your side and try to understand the Zen of Python.

I'll update the file as I go. 

Comment, in the Colab Notebook only, any issues or problems that you might face with the code or any thing you might feel is interesting or missing in the notebook.

I'm a learner too and **learner-to-learner** "Sequential learning"(Learning in a proper order) is the best kind of learning.
